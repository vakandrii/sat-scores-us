# Crimes by NUTS 3 regions

> This project is developed in a **group of 3 people**.

The goal of the project is to explore the relationship of a specific variable with various regressors from a dataset provided by the Sleuth2 library. This concerns the following dataset:

- **ID**: `case1201`
- **Title**: State Average SAT Scores
- **URL**: [Sleuth2: Data Sets from Ramsey and Schafer's "Statistical Sleuth (2nd Ed)", p. 26](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Sleuth2/Sleuth2.pdf)

Our goals:
- Performing basic statistical inquiries and visualizations of the dataset.
- Examine the relationship between the dependent variable and a selected regressors using linear regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
- Select a suitable final regression model using significant regressors from previous tasks.
- Conducting tests to verify the assumptions of the final regression model.
